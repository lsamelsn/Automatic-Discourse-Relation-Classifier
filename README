Automatic Discourse Relation Classifer


Description
-----------
The goal of this project was to build an automatic discourse relation classifier using
the penn discoure tree bank corpus and sklearns naive bayes model.
The performance of the system is included in this repo in the paper pdf.


Usage
-----
USERNAME$ python3 main.py


Requirements
------------
- Python3
- pdtb2
	- I have not included, because of the size, but you can clone the repo [here](https://github.com/cgpotts/pdtb2.git)
	- Note: Be sure pdtb2 appears in the same directory as main.py
	- make sure to unzip pdtb2.csv.zip, this is the corpus data
- Libraries
	- nltk
	- numpy
	- string
	- sklearn


My Process
----------
This next part will be me describing how exactly I coded this project

1. load the corpus
2. pre process the corpus
	- lowercase
	- punctuation
	- stopwords
	- numbers
3. convert the corpus into a format that can be fed into sklearns models
4. split the data into training data, testing data, training labels, testing labels
5. convert text into tfdif format
6. train the testing data on the Naive Bayes model
7. run the model on the test data
8. evaluate
